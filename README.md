<h3> Background Project :</h3>
<p> NHTSA is one such department government in the United States focused on reducing the number
traffic accident on the highway.
Currently NHTSA is brewing a new regulation that will be implemented next year
. I was asked to
analyze the data collected during 2021. This data is data
complete information about accidents that occurred during 2021.</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p> The main purpose is to provide a number of recommendations
about how to reduce the number of accidents on the highway. To do this,
first I  need to identify the following data:</p>
<p>•  Conditions that increase the risk of an accident </p>
<p>•  Top 10 states where the most accidents occur </p>
<p>•  The average number of accidents per day by hour accident </p>
<p>•  Percentage of accidents caused by drunk drivers </p>
<p>•  Percentage of accidents in rural and urban areas </p>
<p>•  Number of accidents by day </p>

<h3>Data Preparation</h3>
<h4>Data Validation</h4>
<p> All the data must be checked whetever there is a abnormal data. The  queery for data checking and validating :</p>

As you can see, once there's enough text in this box, the box will grow scroll bars... that's why we call it a scroll box! You could also place an image into the scroll box.
